# This file contains the dictionary of
# all telemetry values, their TLM logger
# types, location in code, hex codes, and
# and a printf format string
#
# Each tlm is in a block separated by a
# line of whitespace on either side.
# Put each field on its own line.
#
# For now there is very minimal support
# for comments. Only write a comment at
# the beginning of an entry (before the
# hex code)
#
# Also, always maintain a blank line at
# the end of the document!

# Ideas:
#   Hex code numbering:
#     1. Alphabetical
#     2. Type
#     3. Location
#
#  Create an awk program to parse this into
#  html for easy display
#
#  Create a parser to run strings against this
#  dictionary and spit out human readable
#
#  Create a script to easily insert values in
#  order into this document

# This file contains the dictionary of
# all telemetry values, their types, location
# hex codes, and parameters, if they have any.
#
# Each tlm is in a block separated by a
# line of whitespace on either side.
# Put each field on its own line.
#
# Use comments sparingly, I don't want to
# have to write a complex comment parser...

# Ideas:
#   Hex code numbering:
#     1. Alphabetical
#     2. Type
#     3. Location
#
#  Create an awk program to parse this into
#  html for easy display
#
#  Create a parser to run strings against this
#  dictionary and spit out human readable
#
#  Create a script to easily insert values in
#  order into this document

# Last Modified: Jack Dinkel 01/10/17
#
# This file contains the dictionary of
# all telemetry values, their TLM logger
# types, location in code and number of times
# they occur in that file, hex codes, a
# printf format string, and comma delimeted
# parameter types.
#
# Each tlm is in a block separated by a
# line of whitespace on either side.
# Put each field on its own line.
#
# For now there is very minimal support
# for comments. Only write a comment at
# the beginning of an entry (before the
# hex code)
#
# Also, always maintain a blank line at
# the end of the document!

Ideas:
  Hex code numbering:
    1. Alphabetical
    2. Type
    3. Location

 Create an awk program to parse this into
 html for easy display

 Create a parser to run strings against this
 dictionary and spit out human readable

 Create a script to easily insert values in
 order into this document
